<p>Hello, Welcome to my Bua235 Website Assignment! </p>
<p>Currently, I am a student at The University of Maine. I am studying business with a major in accounting. In the past I graduated from Cony High School in Augusta  </p>
<p>On a personal level, I was born and raised in Maine, and currently live in Augusta when not on campus. In my free time (what's that?) I enjoy gaming as well as getting outside for fishing, camping or other Maine things.  </p>
